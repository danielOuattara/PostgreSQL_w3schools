# PostgreSQL SELECT DISTINCT

##  The SELECT DISTINCT Statement

The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to return only
distinct, different values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values and
sometimes you only want to list the different, distinct values.

> Select only the DISTINCT values from the country column
> in the customers table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM customers;
```

Even though the customers table has 91 records, it only has 21
different countries, and that is what you get as a result when
executing the SELECT DISTINCT statement above

##  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT)

We can also use the `DISTINCT` keyword in combination with the
COUNT statement, which in the example below will return the number
of different countries there are in the customers table.

> Return the number of different countries there are in the customers table:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) FROM customers;
```
