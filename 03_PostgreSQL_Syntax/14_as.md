# PostgreSQL AS

##  Aliases

`SQL aliases` are used to give a table, or a column in a table,
a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

**An alias only exists for the duration of that query.**

An alias is created with the `AS` keyword.

> Using aliases for columns:

```sql
SELECT customer_id AS id
FROM customers;
```

##  AS is Optional

Actually, you can skip the `AS` keyword and get the same result:

> Same result without AS:

```sql
SELECT customer_id id
FROM customers;
```

##  Concatenate Columns

The `AS` keyword is often used when two or more fields are
concatenated into one.

To concatenate two fields use `||`.

> Concatenate two fields and call them product:

```sql
SELECT product_name || unit AS product
FROM products;
```

>
>**Note:**
>
> In the result of the example above we are missing a space
> between product_name and unit. To add a space when concatenating,
> use || ' ' ||.

> Concatenate, with space:

```sql
SELECT product_name || ' ' || unit AS product
FROM products;
```

##  Using Aliases With a Space Character

If you want your alias to contain one or more spaces,
like `My Great Products`,then surround your alias with
double quotes.

> Surround your alias with double quotes:

```sql
SELECT product_name AS "My Great Products"
FROM products;


-- alias for one column
SELECT 
    *,  
    product_name AS "My Great Products"
FROM products;


-- count customer by country

SELECT 
    country, 
    count(country) as "Customer By Count" 
FROM
    customers 
GROUP BY country;

```
