# PostgreSQL ADD COLUMN

##  The ALTER TABLE Statement

To add a column to an existing table, we have to use the
`ALTER TABLE` statement.

The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to add, delete, or modify
columns in an existing table.

The `ALTER TABLE` statement is also used to add and drop various
constraints on an existing table.

## ADD COLUMN

We want to add a column named color to our cars table.

When adding columns we must also specify the data type of the column.

Our color column will be a string, and we specify string types with
the `VARCHAR` keyword. we also want to restrict the number of characters to 255:

**Add a column named color:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD color VARCHAR(255);
```

Result

```sql
ALTER TABLE
```

##  Display Table

To check the result we can display the table with this SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

As you can see, the cars table now has a color column.

The new column is empty, you will learn how to fill it with values
in the next chapter.
